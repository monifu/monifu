/**
  * A simple interface that models the producer side of a producer-consumer
  * communication channel.
  *
  * In a producer-consumer communication channel we've got these concerns
  * to take care of:
  *
  *  - back-pressure, which is handled automatically via this interface
  *  - halting the channel with a final event and informing all current and
  *    future consumers about it, while stopping future producers from pushing
  *    more events
  *
  * The `ProducerF` interface takes care of these concerns via:
  *
  *  - the `F[Boolean]` result, which should return `true` for as long as
  *    the channel wasn't halted, so further events can be pushed; these
  *    tasks also block (asynchronously) when internal buffers are full,
  *    so back-pressure concerns are handled automatically
  *  - [[monix.catnap.ProducerF!.halt halt]], being able to close the channel
  *    with a final event that will be visible to all current and future
  *    consumers
  *
  * Currently implemented by [[ConcurrentChannel]].
