/** `Var` when subscribed, will emit the most recently emitted item by the source,
  * or the `initial` (as the seed) in case no value has yet been emitted, then continuing
  * to emit events subsequent to the time of invocation via an underlying [[ConcurrentSubject]].
  * Note that this data type is equivalent to a `ConcurrentSubject.behavior(Unbounded)` with
  * additional functionality to expose the current value for immediate usage.
  *
  * Sample usage:
  *
  * {{{
  *   import monix.reactive._
  *   import monix.reactive.subjects.Var
  *   import monix.execution.Scheduler.Implicits.global
  *
  *   val a = Var(0)
  *   val b = Var(0)
  *
  *   // Sum that gets re-calculated "reactively"
  *   val sum = Observable.combineLatestMap2(a, b)(_ + _)
  *
  *   // Subscribes for updates
  *   sum.dump("Sum").subscribe()
  *
  *   a := 4
  *   // 0: Sum --> 4
  *   b := 5
  *   // 1: Sum --> 9
  *   a := 10
  *   // 0: Sum --> 15
