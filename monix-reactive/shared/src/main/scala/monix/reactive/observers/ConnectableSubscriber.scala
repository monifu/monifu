/** Wraps a [[Subscriber]] into an implementation that abstains from emitting items until the call
  * to `connect()` happens. Prior to `connect()` you can enqueue
  * events for delivery once `connect()` happens, but before any items
  * emitted by `onNext` / `onComplete` and `onError`.
  *
  * Example: {{{
  *   import monix.execution.Ack.Continue
  *   import monix.execution.Scheduler.Implicits.global
  *
  *   val subscriber = new Subscriber[String] {
  *     val scheduler = global
  *     def onNext(a: String) = {
  *       println(s"Received: $$a")
  *       Continue
  *     }
  *     def onError(e: Throwable) =
  *       e.printStackTrace()
  *     def onComplete() =
  *       println("Completed!")
  *   }
  *
  *   val out = ConnectableSubscriber(subscriber)
  *
  *   // schedule onNext event, after connect()
  *   out.onNext("c")
  *
  *   // schedule event "a" to be emitted first
  *   out.pushFirst("a")
  *   // schedule event "b" to be emitted second
  *   out.pushFirst("b")
  *
  *   // underlying observer now gets events "a", "b", "c" in order
  *   out.connect()
  * }}}
  *
  * Example of an observer ended in error: {{{
  *   val out2 = ConnectableSubscriber(subscriber)
  *
  *   // schedule onNext event, after connect()
  *   out2.onNext("c")
  *
  *   out2.pushFirst("a") // event "a" to be emitted first
  *   out2.pushFirst("b") // event "b" to be emitted second
  *
  *   // schedule an onError sent downstream, once connect()
  *   // happens, but after "a" and "b"
  *   out2.pushError(new RuntimeException())
  *
  *   // underlying observer receives ...
  *   // onNext("a") -> onNext("b") -> onError(RuntimeException)
  *   out2.connect()
