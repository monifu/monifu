sealed abstract class MulticastStrategy[+A] extends Serializable

/** The [[MulticastStrategy]] enumerated.
  *
  * @define publish The `Publish` strategy is for emitting to a subscriber
  *         only those items that are emitted by the source subsequent
  *         to the time of the subscription.
  *
  *         Corresponds to [[Pipe.publish]].
  *
  * @define behavior The `Behavior` strategy is for building multicast observables that
  *         emit the most recently emitted item by the source before the
  *         source starts being mirrored.
  *
  *         Corresponds to [[Pipe.behavior]].
  *
  * @define async The `Async` strategy is for building multicast observables that
  *         emit the last value (and only the last value) of the source
  *         and only after the source completes.
  *
  *         Corresponds to [[Pipe.async]].
  *
  * @define replay The `Replay` strategy is for building multicast observables
  *         that repeat all the generated items by the source, regardless of
  *         when the source is subscribed.
  *
  *         Corresponds to [[Pipe.replay[A](initial:Seq[A]* Pipe.replay]].
  *
  * @define replayLimited   The `ReplayLimited` strategy is for building multicast
  *         observables that repeat the generated items by the source, but limited by the
  *         maximum size of the underlying buffer.
  *
  *         When maximum size is reached, the underlying buffer starts dropping
  *         older events. Note that the size of the resulting buffer is not necessarily
  *         the given capacity, as the implementation may choose to increase it for optimisation
  *         purposes.
  *
  *         Corresponds to [[Pipe.replayLimited[A](capacity:Int,initial* Pipe.replayLimited]].
