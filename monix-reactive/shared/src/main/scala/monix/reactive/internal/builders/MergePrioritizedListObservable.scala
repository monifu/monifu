/** Given a sequence of priority/observable pairs, combines them into a new
  * observable that eagerly emits source items downstream as soon as demand is
  * signaled, choosing the item from the highest priority (greater numbers
  * mean higher priority) source when items from multiple sources are
  * available. If items are available from multiple sources with the same
  * highest priority, one of them is chosen arbitrarily.
  *
  * Source items are buffered only to the extent necessary to accommodate
  * backpressure from downstream, and thus if only a single item is available
  * when demand is signaled, it will be emitted regardless of priority.
  *
  * Backpressure is propagated from downstream to the source observables, so
  * that items from a given source will always be emitted downstream in the
  * same order as received from the source, and at most a single item from a
  * given source will be in flight at a time.
