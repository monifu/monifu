/** Implementation for `Observable.concatMap`.
  *
  * Example of what we want to achieve:
  * 
  * `observable.concatMap(x => Observable.range(0, x))`
  *
  * The challenges are:
  *
  *  - keeping track of the `Cancelable` for the active task
  *
  *  - dealing with the concurrency between the last `onNext` and the
  *    final `onComplete` or `onError`, because with the `Observer`
  *    contract we are allowed to send a final event after the last
  *    `onNext` is called, but before its `Future[Ack]` is finished
  *
  * Performance optimizations:
  *
  *  - the state is stored and synchronized using an atomic reference
  *    that is padded to avoid false sharing
  *
  *  - in order to evolve the state we are NOT using intrinsic
  *    monitors (`synchronize`), or `compareAndSet`, but plain writes,
  *    along with `getAndSet`
  *
  *  - currently for each `onNext` we are doing 3 `getAndSet`
  *    operations per `onNext` call, which is awesome because on top
  *    of Java 8 `getAndSet` operations are cheaper than
  *    `compareAndSet`. It is more of a problem on Java 7 and below,
  *    however it's OK-ish, since these CAS operations are not going
  *    to be contended
