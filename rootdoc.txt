This is the API documentation for the [[https://monix.io Monix]] library.

==Package Overview==

'''[[monix.execution]]''' exposes lower level primitives for dealing
with asynchronous execution:
    
 - [[monix.execution.atomic]] exposes the `Atomic` types, as alternative
   to `java.util.concurrent.atomic`   
 - [[monix.execution.cancelables]] contains several
   useful [[monix.execution.Cancelable Cancelable]] implementations
   
 - [[monix.execution.schedulers]] contains several
   useful [[monix.execution.Scheduler Scheduler]] implementations
 - [[monix.execution.rstreams]] contains helpers for dealing
   with the [[http://www.reactive-streams.org Reactive Streams]] specification
 - [[monix.execution.misc]] provides miscellaneous primitives
   useful for dealing with concurrency

'''[[monix.eval]]''' is for dealing with evaluation of results, thus exposing
[[monix.eval.Task Task]] and [[monix.eval.Coeval Coeval]].

'''[[monix.reactive]]''' exposes the `Observable` pattern:

 - [[monix.reactive.exceptions]] groups some exceptions thrown by the implementation
 - [[monix.reactive.observables]] groups reusable `Observable` implementations
 - [[monix.reactive.observers]] groups reusable [[monix.reactive.Observer Observer]]
   implementations
 - [[monix.reactive.subjects]] exposes [[monix.reactive.subjects.Subject Subject]]
   and [[monix.reactive.subjects.ConcurrentSubject ConcurrentSubject]],
   which are implementations of hot observables that function both as input and output
