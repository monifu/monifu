/** The `Applicative` type-class is a [[Functor]] that also adds the
  * capability of lifting a value in the context.
  *
  * Described in
  * [[http://www.soi.city.ac.uk/~ross/papers/Applicative.html
  * Applicative Programming with Effects]].
  *
  * To implement `Functor`:
  *
  *  - inherit from [[Functor.Type]] in derived type-classes
  *  - inherit from [[Functor.Instance]] when implementing instances
  *
  * The purpose of this type-class is to support the data-types in the
  * Monix library and it is considered a shim for a lawful type-class
  * to be supplied by libraries such as Cats or Scalaz or equivalent.
  *
  * CREDITS: The type-class encoding has been inspired by the Scato
  * project by AloÃ¯s Cochard and [[https://github.com/scalaz/scalaz/ Scalaz 8]]
  * and the type has been extracted from [[http://typelevel.org/cats/ Cats]].
