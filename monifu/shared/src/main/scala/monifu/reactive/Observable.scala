/**
 * The Observable interface in the Rx pattern.
 *
 * ==Interface==
 *
 * An Observable is characterized by a `onSubscribe` method that needs
 * to be implemented. In simple terms, an Observable might as well be
 * just a function like:
 * {{{
 *   type Observable[+T] = Subscriber[T] => Unit
 * }}}
 *
 * In other words an Observable is something that provides a
 * side-effecting function that can connect a [[Subscriber]] to
 * a stream of data. A `Subscriber` is a cross between an
 * [[Observer]] and a [[Scheduler]]. We need a [[Scheduler]] when
 * calling `subscribe` because that's when the side-effects happen
 * and a context capable of scheduling tasks for asynchronous
 * execution is needed. An [[Observer]] on the other hand is
 * the interface implemented by consumer and that receives
 * events according to the Rx grammar.
 *
 * On `onSubscribe`, because we need the interesting operators and
 * the polymorphic behavior provided by OOP, the Observable is
 * being described as an interface that has to be implemented:
 * {{{
 *   class MySampleObservable(unit: Int) extends Observable[Int] {
 *     def onSubscribe(sub: Subscriber[Int]): Unit = {
 *       implicit val s = sub.scheduler
 *       // note we must apply back-pressure
 *       // when calling `onNext`
 *       sub.onNext(unit).onComplete {
 *         case Success(Cancel) =>
 *           () // do nothing
 *         case Success(Continue) =>
 *           sub.onComplete()
 *         case Failure(ex) =>
 *           sub.onError(ex)
 *       }
 *     }
 *   }
 * }}}
 *
 * Of course, you don't need to inherit from this trait, as you can just
 * use [[Observable.create]], the following example being equivalent
 * to the above:
 * {{{
 *   Observable.create[Int] { sub =>
 *     implicit val s = sub.scheduler
 *     // note we must apply back-pressure
 *     // when calling `onNext`
 *     sub.onNext(unit).onComplete {
 *       case Success(Cancel) =>
 *         () // do nothing
 *       case Success(Continue) =>
 *         sub.onComplete()
 *       case Failure(ex) =>
 *         sub.onError(ex)
 *     }
 *   }
 * }}}
 *
 * The above is describing how to create your own Observables, however
 * Monifu already provides already made utilities in the
 * [[Observable$ Observable companion object]]. For example, to
 * periodically make a request to a web service, you could do it like
 * this:
 * {{{
 *   // just some http client
 *   import play.api.libs.ws._
 *
 *   // triggers an auto-incremented number every second
 *   Observable.intervalAtFixedRate(1.second)
 *     .flatMap(_ => WS.request(s"http://some.endpoint.com/request?tick=$x").get())
 * }}}
 *
 * As you might notice, in the above example we are doing
 * [[Observable!.flatMap]] on an Observable that emits `Future`
 * instances. And it works, because Monifu considers Scala's Futures
 * to be just a subset of Observables, see the automatic
 * [[Observable.FutureIsObservable FutureIsObservable]] conversion that
 * it defines. Or you could just use [[Observable.fromFuture]] for
 * explicit conversions, an Observable builder available
 * [[Observable$ amongst others]].
 *
 * ==Contract==
 *
 * Observables must obey Monifu's contract, this is why if you get away
 * with already built and tested observables, that would be better than
 * implementing your own by means of inheriting the interface or by using
 * [[Observable.create create]]. The contract is this:
 *
 *   - the supplied `onSubscribe` method MUST NOT throw exceptions, any
 *     unforeseen errors that happen in user-code must be emitted to
 *     the observers and the streaming closed
 *   - events MUST follow this grammar: `onNext* (onComplete | onError)`
 *     - a data source can emit zero or many `onNext` events
 *     - the stream can be infinite, but when the stream is closed
 *       (and not canceled by the observer), then
 *       it always emits a final `onComplete` or `onError`
 *   - MUST apply back-pressure when emitting events, which means that sending
 *     events is always done in response to demand signaled by observers and
 *     that observers should only receive events in response to that signaled
 *     demand
 *     - emitting a new `onNext` event must happen only after the previous
 *       `onNext` completed with a [[Ack.Continue Continue]]
 *     - streaming must stop immediately after an `onNext` event
 *       is signaling a [[Ack.Cancel Cancel]]
 *     - back-pressure must be applied for the final events as well,
 *       so `onComplete` and `onError` must happen only after the previous
 *       `onNext` was completed with a [[Ack.Continue Continue]]
 *       acknowledgement
 *     - the first `onNext` event can be sent directly, since there are no
 *       previous events
 *     - if there are no previous `onNext` events, then streams can be
 *       closed with `onComplete` and `onError` directly
 *     - if buffering of events happens, it is acceptable for events
 *       to get dropped when `onError` happens such that its delivery
 *       is prioritized
 *
 * ===On Dealing with the contract===
 *
 * Back-pressure means in essence that the speed with which the data-source
 * produces events is adjusted to the speed with which the consumer consumes.
 *
 * For example, lets say we want to feed an iterator into an observer,
 * similar to what we are doing in [[Observer.Extensions.feed]],
 * we might build a loop like this:
 * {{{
 *   /** Transforms any Iterable into an Observable */
 *   def fromIterator[T](iterable: Iterable[T]): Observable[T] =
 *     Observable.create { sub =>
 *       implicit val s = sub.scheduler
 *       loop(sub.observer, iterable.iterator).onComplete {
 *         case Success(Cancel) =>
 *           () // do nothing
 *         case Success(Continue) =>
 *           sub.onComplete()
 *         case Failed(ex) =>
 *           reportError(ex)
 *       }
 *     }
 *
 *   private def loop[T](o: Observer[T], iterator: Iterator[T])
 *     (implicit s: Scheduler): Future[Ack] = {
 *
 *     try {
 *       if (iterator.hasNext) {
 *         val next = iterator.next()
 *         // signaling event, applying back-pressure
 *         o.onNext(next).flatMap {
 *           case Cancel => Cancel
 *           case Continue =>
 *             // signal next event (recursive, but async)
 *             loop(o, iterator)
 *         }
 *       }
 *       else {
 *         // nothing left to do, and because we are implementing
 *         // Observer.feed, the final acknowledgement is a `Continue`
 *         // assuming that the observer hasn't canceled or failed
 *         Continue
 *       }
 *     }
 *     catch {
 *       case NonFatal(ex) =>
 *         reportError(ex)
 *     }
 *   }
 *
 *   private def reportError[T](o: Observer[T], ex: Throwable): Cancel =
 *     try o.onError(ex) catch {
 *       case NonFatal(err) =>
 *         // oops, onError failed, trying to
 *         // report it somewhere
 *         s.reportFailure(ex)
 *         s.reportFailure(err)
 *         Cancel
 *     }
 * }}}
 *
 * There are cases in which the data-source can't be slowed down in response
 * to the demand signaled through back-pressure. For such cases buffering
 * is needed.
 *
 * For example to "imperatively" build an Observable, we could use channels:
 * {{{
 *   val channel = PublishChannel[Int](OverflowStrategy.DropNew(bufferSize = 100))
 *
 *   // look mum, no back-pressure concerns
 *   channel.pushNext(1)
 *   channel.pushNext(2)
 *   channel.pushNext(3)
 *   channel.pushComplete()
 * }}}
 *
 * In Monifu a [[Channel]] is much like a [[Subject]], meaning that it can be
 * used to construct observables, except that a `Channel` has a buffer
 * attached and IS NOT an `Observer` (like the `Subject` is). In Monifu
 * (compared to Rx implementations) [[Subject Subjects]] are subject to
 * back-pressure concerns as well, so they can't be used in an imperative way,
 * like described above, hence the need for Channels.
 *
 * Or for more serious and lower level jobs, you can simply take an
 * `Observer` and wrap it into a [[BufferedSubscriber]].
 *
 * @see [[monifu.reactive.Observer Observer]], the interface that must be
 *     implemented by consumers
 * @see [[monifu.concurrent.Scheduler Scheduler]], our enhanced `ExecutionContext`
 * @see [[monifu.reactive.Subscriber Subscriber]], the cross between an
 *     [[Observer]] and a [[Scheduler]]
 * @see [[monifu.concurrent.Cancelable Cancelable]], the type returned by higher
 *     level `subscribe` variants and that can be used to cancel subscriptions
 * @see [[monifu.reactive.Subject Subject]], which are both Observables and Observers
 * @see [[monifu.reactive.Channel Channel]], which are meant for imperatively building
 *     Observables without back-pressure concerns
 *
 * @define concatDescription Concatenates the sequence
 *         of Observables emitted by the source into one Observable,
 *         without any transformation.
 *
 *         You can combine the items emitted by multiple Observables
 *         so that they act like a single Observable by using this
 *         method.
 *
 *         The difference between the `concat` operation and
 *         [[Observable!.merge merge]] is that `concat` cares about
 *         ordering of emitted items (e.g. all items emitted by the
 *         first observable in the sequence will come before the
 *         elements emitted by the second observable), whereas
 *         `merge` doesn't care about that (elements get emitted as
 *         they come). Because of back-pressure applied to
 *         observables, [[Observable!.concat]] is safe to use in all
 *         contexts, whereas `merge` requires buffering.
 *
 * @define concatReturn an Observable that emits items that are the result of
 *         flattening the items emitted by the Observables emitted
 *         by `this`
 *
 * @define mergeMapDescription Creates a new Observable by applying a
 *         function that you supply to each item emitted by the source
 *         Observable, where that function returns an Observable, and then
 *         merging those resulting Observables and emitting the
 *         results of this merger.
 *
 *         This function is the equivalent of `observable.map(f).merge`.
 *
 *         The difference between [[Observable!.concat concat]] and
 *         `merge` is that `concat` cares about ordering of emitted
 *         items (e.g. all items emitted by the first observable in
 *         the sequence will come before the elements emitted by the
 *         second observable), whereas `merge` doesn't care about that
 *         (elements get emitted as they come). Because of
 *         back-pressure applied to observables, [[Observable!.concat concat]]
 *         is safe to use in all contexts, whereas [[Observable!.merge]]
 *         requires buffering.
 *
 * @define mergeMapReturn an Observable that emits the result of applying the
 *         transformation function to each item emitted by the source
 *         Observable and merging the results of the Observables
 *         obtained from this transformation.
 *
 * @define mergeDescription Merges the sequence of Observables emitted by
 *         the source into one Observable, without any transformation.
 *
 *         You can combine the items emitted by multiple Observables
 *         so that they act like a single Observable by using this
 *         method.
 *
 * @define mergeReturn an Observable that emits items that are the
 *         result of flattening the items emitted by the Observables
 *         emitted by `this`
 *
 * @define overflowStrategyParam the [[OverflowStrategy overflow strategy]]
 *         used for buffering, which specifies what to do in case we're
 *         dealing with a slow consumer - should an unbounded buffer be used,
 *         should back-pressure be applied, should the pipeline drop newer or
 *         older events, should it drop the whole buffer? See
 *         [[OverflowStrategy]] for more details
 *
 * @define onOverflowParam a function that is used for signaling a special
 *         event used to inform the consumers that an overflow event
 *         happened, function that receives the number of dropped events as
 *         a parameter (see [[OverflowStrategy.Evicted]])
 *
 * @define delayErrorsDescription This version
 *         is reserving onError notifications until all of the
 *         Observables complete and only then passing the issued
 *         errors(s) along to the observers. Note that the streamed
 *         error is a [[CompositeException]], since multiple errors
 *         from multiple streams can happen.
 *
 * @define defaultOverflowStrategy this operation needs to do buffering
 *         and by not specifying an [[OverflowStrategy]], the
 *         [[OverflowStrategy.default default strategy]] is being
 *         used.
 *
 * @define switchDescription Convert an Observable that emits Observables
 *         into a single Observable that emits the items emitted by the
 *         most-recently-emitted of those Observables.
 *
 * @define asyncBoundaryDescription Forces a buffered asynchronous boundary.
 *
 *         Internally it wraps the observer implementation given to
 *         `onSubscribe` into a
 *         [[monifu.reactive.observers.BufferedSubscriber BufferedSubscriber]].
 *
 *         Normally Monifu's implementation guarantees that events
 *         are not emitted concurrently, and that the publisher MUST
 *         NOT emit the next event without acknowledgement from the
 *         consumer that it may proceed, however for badly behaved
 *         publishers, this wrapper provides the guarantee that the
 *         downstream [[monifu.reactive.Observer Observer]] given in
 *         `subscribe` will not receive concurrent events.
 *
 *         WARNING: if the buffer created by this operator is
 *         unbounded, it can blow up the process if the data source
 *         is pushing events faster than what the observer can
 *         consume, as it introduces an asynchronous boundary that
 *         eliminates the back-pressure requirements of the data
 *         source. Unbounded is the default
 *         [[monifu.reactive.OverflowStrategy overflowStrategy]], see
 *         [[monifu.reactive.OverflowStrategy OverflowStrategy]] for
 *         options.
