/** To do comparative benchmarks between versions:
  *
  *     benchmarks/run-benchmark AsyncQueueBenchmark
  *
  * This will generate results in `benchmarks/results`.
  *
  * Or to run the benchmark from within SBT:
  *
  *     jmh:run -i 10 -wi 10 -f 2 -t 1 monix.benchmarks.AsyncQueueBenchmark
  *
  * Which means "10 iterations", "10 warm-up iterations", "2 forks", "1 thread".
  * Please note that benchmarks should be usually executed at least in
  * 10 iterations (as a rule of thumb), but more is better.
