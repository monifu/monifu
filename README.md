## Overview

Monix is a high-performance Scala / Scala.js library for
composing asynchronous and event-based programs using observable sequences
that are exposed as asynchronous streams, expanding on the
[observer pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_pattern),
strongly inspired by [ReactiveX](http://reactivex.io/),
but designed from the ground up  for back-pressure and made to cleanly interact
with Scala's standard library and compatible out-of-the-box with the
[Reactive Streams](http://www.reactive-streams.org/) protocol.

Highlights:

- exposes the kick-ass `Observable`, `Task` and `Coeval`
- modular, only use what you need
- the core has no third-party dependencies
- strives to be idiomatic Scala and encourages referential transparency,
  but is built to be faster than alternatives
- accepted in the [Typelevel incubator](http://typelevel.org/projects/)
- designed for true asynchronicity, running on both the
  JVM and [Scala.js](scala-js.org),
- really good test coverage and API documentation as a project policy

## Usage

See **[monix-sample](https://github.com/monix/monix-sample)** for
a project exemplifying Monix used both on the server and on the client.

### Dependencies

The packages are published on Maven Central.

- Current stable release: `2.0.5`
- Old 1.x release (Monifu): `1.2`

For the current stable release (use the `%%%` for Scala.js):

```scala
libraryDependencies += "io.monix" %% "monix" % "2.0.5"
```

For the old 1.x release (use the `%%%` for Scala.js):

```scala
libraryDependencies += "org.monifu" %% "monifu" % "1.2"
```

### Sub-projects

Monix 2.x is modular by design, so you can pick and choose:

- `monix-types` exposes type-classes and shims needed for
  integration with other FP libraries (Cats, Scalaz)
- `monix-execution` exposes the low-level execution environment, or more precisely
  `Scheduler`, `Cancelable`, `Atomic` and `CancelableFuture`
- `monix-eval` exposes `Task`, `Coeval`
   and depends on `monix-execution` and `monix-types`
- `monix-reactive` exposes `Observable` streams
   and depends on `monix-eval` and `monix-types`
- `monix` provides all of the above

Optional packages:

- `monix-cats` provides integration with [Cats](http://typelevel.org/cats) and
   depends on `monix-types` and `org.typelevel.cats-core`
- `monix-scalaz-72` provides integration with [Scalaz](http://scalaz.org) and
   depends on `monix-types` and `org.scalaz.scalaz-core` version 7.2.x
