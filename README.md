## Overview

Monix is a high-performance Scala / Scala.js library for composing asynchronous,
event-based programs.

It started as a proper implementation of [ReactiveX](http://reactivex.io/),
with stronger functional programming influences and designed from the ground up
for  back-pressure and made to interact cleanly with Scala's standard library,
compatible out-of-the-box with the [Reactive Streams](http://www.reactive-streams.org/)
protocol. It then expanded to include abstractions for suspending side effects
and for resource handling, and is one of the parents and implementors of
[Cats Effect](https://typelevel.org/cats-effect/).

A [Typelevel project](http://typelevel.org/projects/), Monix proudly
exemplifies pure, typeful, functional programming in Scala, while being pragmatic,
and making no compromise on performance.

Highlights:

- exposes the kick-ass [Observable](https://monix.io/docs/current/reactive/observable.html), 
  [Iterant](https://monix.io/api/current/monix/tail/Iterant.html), 
  [Task](https://monix.io/docs/current/eval/task.html) and 
  [Coeval](https://monix.io/docs/current/eval/coeval.html) data types,
  along with all the support they need
- *modular*, split into multiple sub-projects, only use what you need
- designed for true asynchronicity, running on both the
  JVM and [Scala.js](http://scala-js.org)
- excellent test coverage, code quality, and API documentation
  as a primary project policy

## Usage

- Use **[monix-jvm-app-template.g8](https://github.com/monix/monix-jvm-app-template.g8)**
for quickly getting started with a Monix-driven app
- See **[monix-sample](https://github.com/monix/monix-sample)** for
a project exemplifying Monix used both on the server and on the client.

### Library dependency (sbt)

For the stable release (compatible with Cats, and Cats-Effect 2.x):
 
```scala
libraryDependencies += "io.monix" %% "monix" % "3.2.2"
```
  
### Sub-projects

Monix 3.x is modular by design. See the [sub-modules graph](https://monix.io/docs/current/intro/usage.html#sub-modules--dependencies-graph):

  alt="Sub-modules graph" />

You can pick and choose:

- `monix-execution` exposes the low-level execution environment, or
  more precisely `Scheduler`, `Cancelable`, `Atomic`, `Local`, `CancelableFuture`
  and `Future` based abstractions from `monix-catnap`.
- `monix-catnap` exposes pure abstractions built on top of
   the [Cats-Effect](https://typelevel.org/cats-effect/) type classes;
   depends on `monix-execution`, Cats 1.x and Cats-Effect
- `monix-eval` exposes `Task`, `Coeval`;
  depends on `monix-execution`
- `monix-reactive` exposes `Observable` for modeling reactive,
  push-based streams with back-pressure; depends on `monix-eval`
- `monix-tail` exposes `Iterant` streams for purely functional pull
  based streaming; depends on `monix-eval` and makes heavy use of
  Cats-Effect
- `monix` provides all of the above
