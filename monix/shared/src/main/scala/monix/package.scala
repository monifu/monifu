/** Base package for the Monix library.
  *
  * The core is being split in the following sub-packages:
  *
  *  - '''[[monix.execution]]''' exposes lower level primitives for dealing
  *    with asynchronous execution, corresponding to the `monix-execution`
  *    sub-project
  *  - '''[[monix.catnap]]''' exposes pure abstractions built on top of
  *    the [[https://typelevel.org/cats-effect/ Cats-Effect]] type classes,
  *    corresponding to the `monix-catnap` sub-project
  *  - '''[[monix.eval]]''' is for dealing with evaluation of results,
  *    thus exposing [[monix.eval.Task Task]] and [[monix.eval.Coeval Coeval]],
  *    corresponding to the `monix-eval` sub-project
  *  - '''[[monix.reactive]]''' exposes the [[monix.reactive.Observable Observable]]
  *    pattern, corresponding to the `monix-reactive` sub-project
  *  - '''[[monix.tail]]''' exposes [[monix.tail.Iterant Iterant]]
  *    the reasonable, pull based, streaming abstraction
