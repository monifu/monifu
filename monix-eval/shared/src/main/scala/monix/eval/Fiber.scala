import monix.eval.internal.TaskCancellation

/** `Fiber` represents the (pure) result of a [[Task]] being started concurrently
  * and that can be either joined or cancelled.
  *
  * You can think of fibers as being lightweight threads, a fiber being a
  * concurrency primitive for doing cooperative multi-tasking.
  *
  * For example a `Fiber` value is the result of evaluating [[Task.start]]:
  *
  * {{{
  *   val task = Task(println("Hello!"))
  *
  *   val forked: Task[Fiber[Unit]] = task.start
  * }}}
  *
  * Usage example:
  *
  * {{{
  *   for {
  *     fiber <- launchMissiles.start
  *     _ <- runToBunker.handleErrorWith { error =>
  *       // Retreat failed, cancel launch (maybe we should
  *       // have retreated to our bunker before the launch?)
  *       fiber.cancel.flatMap(_ => Task.raiseError(error))
  *     }
  *     aftermath <- fiber.join
  *   } yield {
  *     aftermath
  *   }
  * }}}
