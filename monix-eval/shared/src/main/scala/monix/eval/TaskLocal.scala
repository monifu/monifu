import monix.execution.misc.Local

/** A `TaskLocal` is like a
  * [[monix.execution.misc.ThreadLocal ThreadLocal]]
  * that is pure and with a flexible scope, being processed in the
  * context of the [[Task]] data type.
  *
  * This data type wraps [[monix.execution.misc.Local]].
  *
  * Just like a `ThreadLocal`, usage of a `TaskLocal` is safe,
  * the state of all current locals being transported over
  * async boundaries (aka when threads get forked) by the `Task`
  * run-loop implementation, but only when the `Task` reference
  * gets executed with [[Task.Options.localContextPropagation]]
  * set to `true`.
  *
  * One way to achieve this is with [[Task.executeWithOptions]],
  * a single call is sufficient just before `runAsync`:
  *
  * {{{
  *   task.executeWithOptions(_.enableLocalContextPropagation)
  *     // triggers the actual execution
  *     .runAsync
  * }}}
  *
  * Another possibility is to use
  * [[Task.runAsyncOpt(implicit* .runAsyncOpt]] instead of `runAsync`
  * and specify the set of options implicitly:
  *
  * {{{
  *   implicit val opts = Task.defaultOptions.enableLocalContextPropagation
  *
  *   // Options passed implicitly
  *   val f = task.runAsyncOpt
  * }}}
  *
  * Full example:
  *
  * {{{
  *   import monix.eval.{Task, TaskLocal}
  *
  *   val local = TaskLocal(0)
  *
  *   val task: Task[Unit] =
  *     for {
  *       value1 <- local.read // value1 == 0
  *       _ <- local.write(100)
  *       value2 <- local.read // value2 == 100
  *       value3 <- local.bind(200)(local.read.map(_ * 2)) // value3 == 200 * 2
  *       value4 <- local.read // value4 == 100
  *       _ <- local.clear
  *       value5 <- local.read // value5 == 0
  *     } yield {
  *       // Should print 0, 100, 400, 100, 0
  *       println("value1: " + value1)
  *       println("value2: " + value2)
  *       println("value3: " + value3)
  *       println("value4: " + value4)
  *       println("value5: " + value5)
  *     }
  *
  *   // For transporting locals over async boundaries defined by
  *   // Task, any Scheduler will do, however for transporting locals
  *   // over async boundaries managed by Future and others, you need
  *   // a `TracingScheduler` here:
  *   import monix.execution.Scheduler.Implicits.global
  *
  *   // Needs enabling the "localContextPropagation" option
  *   // just before execution
  *   implicit val opts = Task.defaultOptions.enableLocalContextPropagation
  *
  *   // Triggering actual execution
  *   val f = task.runAsyncOpt
  * }}}
