/** The `TaskCircuitBreaker` is used to provide stability and prevent
  * cascading failures in distributed systems.
  *
  * =Purpose=
  *
  * As an example, we have a web application interacting with a remote
  * third party web service. Let's say the third party has oversold
  * their capacity and their database melts down under load. Assume
  * that the database fails in such a way that it takes a very long
  * time to hand back an error to the third party web service. This in
  * turn makes calls fail after a long period of time.  Back to our
  * web application, the users have noticed that their form
  * submissions take much longer seeming to hang. Well the users do
  * what they know to do which is use the refresh button, adding more
  * requests to their already running requests.  This eventually
  * causes the failure of the web application due to resource
  * exhaustion. This will affect all users, even those who are not
  * using functionality dependent on this third party web service.
  *
  * Introducing circuit breakers on the web service call would cause
  * the requests to begin to fail-fast, letting the user know that
  * something is wrong and that they need not refresh their
  * request. This also confines the failure behavior to only those
  * users that are using functionality dependent on the third party,
  * other users are no longer affected as there is no resource
  * exhaustion. Circuit breakers can also allow savvy developers to
  * mark portions of the site that use the functionality unavailable,
  * or perhaps show some cached content as appropriate while the
  * breaker is open.
  *
  * =How It Works=
  *
  * The circuit breaker models a concurrent state machine that
  * can be in any of these 3 states:
  *
  *  1. [[TaskCircuitBreaker$.Closed Closed]]: During normal
  *     operations or when the `TaskCircuitBreaker` starts
  *    - Exceptions increment the `failures` counter
  *    - Successes reset the failure count to zero
  *    - When the `failures` counter reaches the `maxFailures` count,
  *      the breaker is tripped into `Open` state
  *
  *  1. [[TaskCircuitBreaker$.Open Open]]: The circuit breaker rejects
  *     all tasks with an
  *     [[monix.execution.exceptions.ExecutionRejectedException ExecutionRejectedException]]
  *    - all tasks fail fast with `ExecutionRejectedException`
  *    - after the configured `resetTimeout`, the circuit breaker
  *      enters a [[TaskCircuitBreaker$.HalfOpen HalfOpen]] state,
  *      allowing one task to go through for testing the connection
  *
  *  1. [[TaskCircuitBreaker$.HalfOpen HalfOpen]]: The circuit breaker
  *     has already allowed a task to go through, as a reset attempt,
  *     in order to test the connection
  *    - The first task when `Open` has expired is allowed through
  *      without failing fast, just before the circuit breaker is
  *      evolved into the `HalfOpen` state
  *    - All tasks attempted in `HalfOpen` fail-fast with an exception
  *      just as in [[TaskCircuitBreaker$.Open Open]] state
  *    - If that task attempt succeeds, the breaker is reset back to
  *      the `Closed` state, with the `resetTimeout` and the
  *      `failures` count also reset to initial values
  *    - If the first call fails, the breaker is tripped again into
  *      the `Open` state (the `resetTimeout` is multiplied by the
  *      exponential backoff factor)
  *
  * =Usage=
  *
  * {{{
  *   import monix.eval._
  *   import scala.concurrent.duration._
  *
  *   val circuitBreaker = TaskCircuitBreaker(
  *     maxFailures = 5,
  *     resetTimeout = 10.seconds
  *   )
  *
  *   //...
  *   val problematic = Task.evalAsync {
  *     val nr = util.Random.nextInt()
  *     if (nr % 2 == 0) nr else
  *       throw new RuntimeException("dummy")
  *   }
  *
  *   val task = circuitBreaker
  *     .flatMap(_.protect(problematic))
  * }}}
  *
  * When attempting to close the circuit breaker and resume normal
  * operations, we can also apply an exponential backoff for repeated
  * failed attempts, like so:
  *
  * {{{
  *   val exponential = TaskCircuitBreaker(
  *     maxFailures = 5,
  *     resetTimeout = 10.seconds,
  *     exponentialBackoffFactor = 2,
  *     maxResetTimeout = 10.minutes
  *   )
  * }}}
  *
  * In this sample we attempt to reconnect after 10 seconds, then after
  * 20, 40 and so on, a delay that keeps increasing up to a configurable
  * maximum of 10 minutes.
  *
  * =Credits=
  *
  * This Monix data type was inspired by the availability of
  * [[http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/current/common/circuitbreaker.html Akka's Circuit Breaker]].
