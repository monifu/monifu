/** `Coeval` represents lazy computations that can execute synchronously.
  *
  * Word definition and origin:
  *
  *  - Having the same age or date of origin; a contemporary; synchronous.
  *  - From the Latin "coævus": com- ‎("equal") in combination with aevum ‎(aevum, "age").
  *  - The constructor of `Coeval` is the dual of an expression that evaluates to an `A`.
  *
  * There are three evaluation strategies:
  *
  *  - [[monix.eval.Coeval.now now]] or
  *    [[monix.eval.Coeval.raiseError raiseError]]: for describing
  *    strict values, evaluated immediately
  *  - [[monix.eval.Coeval.evalOnce evalOnce]]: expressions evaluated a single time
  *  - [[monix.eval.Coeval.eval eval]]: expressions evaluated every time
  *    the value is needed
  *
  * The `Once` and `Always` are both lazy strategies while
  * `Now` and `Error` are eager. `Once` and `Always` are
  * distinguished from each other only by memoization: once evaluated
  * `Once` will save the value to be returned immediately if it is
  * needed again. `Always` will run its computation every time.
  *
  * Both `Now` and `Error` are represented by the
  * [[monix.eval.Coeval.Eager Eager]] trait, a sub-type of [[Coeval]]
  * that can be used as a replacement for Scala's own `Try` type.
  *
  * `Coeval` supports stack-safe lazy computation via the
  * [[monix.eval.Coeval!.map .map]] and [[Coeval!.flatMap .flatMap]] methods,
  * which use an internal trampoline to avoid stack overflows.
  * Computations done within `.map` and `.flatMap` are always
  * lazy, even when applied to a
  * [[monix.eval.Coeval.Eager Coeval.Eager]] instance (e.g.
  * [[monix.eval.Coeval.Now Coeval.Now]],
  * [[monix.eval.Coeval.Error Coeval.Error]]).
  *
  * =Evaluation Strategies=
  *
  * The "now" and "raiseError" builders are building `Coeval`
  * instances out of strict values:
  *
  * {{{
  *   val fa = Coeval.now(1)
  *   fa.value //=> 1
  *
  *   val fe = Coeval.raiseError(new DummyException("dummy"))
  *   fe.value //=> throws DummyException
  * }}}
  *
  * The "always" strategy is equivalent with a plain function:
  *
  * {{{
  *   // For didactic purposes, don't use shared vars at home :-)
  *   var i = 0
  *   val fa = Coeval.eval { i += 1; i }
  *
  *   fa.value //=> 1
  *   fa.value //=> 2
  *   fa.value //=> 3
  * }}}
  *
  * The "once" strategy is equivalent with Scala's `lazy val`
  * (along with thread-safe idempotency guarantees):
  *
  * {{{
  *   var i = 0
  *   val fa = Coeval.evalOnce { i += 1; i }
  *
  *   fa.value //=> 1
  *   fa.value //=> 1
  *   fa.value //=> 1
  * }}}
  *
  * =Versus Task=
  *
  * The other option of suspending side-effects is [[Task]].
  * As a quick comparison:
  *
  *  - `Coeval`'s execution is always immediate / synchronous, whereas
  *    `Task` can describe asynchronous computations
  *  - `Coeval` is not cancelable, obviously, since execution is
  *    immediate and there's nothing to cancel
  *
  * =Versus cats.Eval=
  *
  * The `Coeval` data type is very similar with [[cats.Eval]].
  * As a quick comparison:
  *
  *  - `cats.Eval` is only for controlling laziness, but it doesn't
  *    handle side effects, hence `cats.Eval` is a `Comonad`
  *  - Monix's `Coeval` can handle side effects as well and thus it
  *    implements `MonadError[Coeval, Throwable]` and
  *    `cats.effect.Sync`, providing error-handling utilities
  *
  * If you just want to delay the evaluation of a pure expression
  * use `cats.Eval`, but if you need to suspend side effects or you
  * need error handling capabilities, then use `Coeval`.
