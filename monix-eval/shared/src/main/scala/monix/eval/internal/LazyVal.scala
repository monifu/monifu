/** `LazyVal` boxes a function and memoizes its result on its first invocation,
  * to be reused for subsequent invocations.
  *
  * It is the equivalent of Scala's `lazy val`, but can (optionally)
  * cache the result only on successful completion.
  *
  * Guarantees thread-safe idempotency for successful results and
  * also for failures when `onlyOnSuccess = false`.
  *
  * @param f is the function whose result is going to get memoized
  * @param cacheErrors is a boolean that indicates whether
  *        memoization should happen only for successful results,
  *        or for errors as well
