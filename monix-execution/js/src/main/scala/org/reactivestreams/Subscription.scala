/**
  * Represents a one-to-one lifecycle of a [[Subscriber]] subscribing to a [[Publisher]]
  * and mirrors the `Subscription` interface from the
  * [[http://www.reactive-streams.org/ Reactive Streams]] specification.
  *
  * It can be used only once by a single [[Subscriber]]. It is used
  * for both signaling demand for data and for canceling demand (and allow
  * resource cleanup).

  /**
    * No events will be sent by a [[Publisher]] until demand is signaled via this method.
    *
    * It can be called however often and whenever needed.
    * Whatever has been requested can be sent by the [[Publisher]]
    * so only signal demand for what can be safely handled.
    *
    * A [[Publisher]] can send less than is requested if the stream ends but
    * then must emit either `onError` or `onComplete`.
    *
    * The [[Subscriber]] MAY call this method synchronously in the implementation of its
    * `onSubscribe` / `onNext` methods, therefore the effects of this function must be
    * asynchronous, otherwise it could lead to a stack overflow.
    *
    * @param n signals demand for the number of `onNext` events that the [[Subscriber]] wants,
    *          if positive, then the [[Publisher]] is bound by contract to not send more than
    *          this number of `onNext` events and if negative, then this signals to the
    *          [[Publisher]] that it may send an infinite number of events, until the subscription
    *          gets cancelled or the stream is complete.
