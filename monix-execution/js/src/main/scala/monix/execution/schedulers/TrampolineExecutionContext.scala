/** A `scala.concurrentExecutionContext` implementation
  * that executes runnables immediately, on the current thread,
  * by means of a trampoline implementation.
  *
  * Can be used in some cases to keep the asynchronous execution
  * on the current thread, as an optimization, but be warned,
  * you have to know what you're doing.
  *
  * The `TrampolineExecutionContext` keeps a reference to another
  * `underlying` context, to which it defers for:
  *
  *  - reporting errors
  *  - deferring the rest of the queue in problematic situations
  *
  * Deferring the rest of the queue happens:
  *
  *  - in case we have a runnable throwing an exception, the rest
  *    of the tasks get re-scheduled for execution by using
  *    the `underlying` context
  *  - in case we have a runnable triggering a Scala `blocking`
  *    context, the rest of the tasks get re-scheduled for execution
  *    on the `underlying` context to prevent any deadlocks
  *
  * Thus this implementation is compatible with the
  * `scala.concurrent.BlockContext`, detecting `blocking` blocks and
  * reacting by forking the rest of the queue to prevent deadlocks.
  *
  * @param underlying is the `ExecutionContext` to which the it defers
  *        to in case real asynchronous is needed
