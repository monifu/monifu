/**
 * Marks APIs that are considered internal to Akka and may change at
 * any point in time without any warning.
 *
 * For example, this annotation should be used when the Scala
 * `private[monix]` access restriction is used, as Java has no way of
 * representing this package restricted access and such methods and
 * classes are represented as public in byte-code.
 *
 * If a method/class annotated with this method has a javadoc/scaladoc
 * comment, the first line MUST include INTERNAL API in order to be
 * easily identifiable from generated documentation. Additional
 * information may be put on the same line as the INTERNAL API comment
 * in order to clarify further.
