/** A small toolkit of classes that support compare-and-swap semantics
  * for safe mutation of variables.
  *
  * On top of the JVM, this means dealing with lock-free thread-safe
  * programming. Also works on top of Javascript, with ''Scala.js'',
  * for API compatibility purposes and because it's a useful way to
  * box a value.
  *
  * The backbone of Atomic references is this method:
  * {{{
  *   def compareAndSet(expect: T, update: T): Boolean
  * }}}
  *
  * This method atomically sets a variable to the `update` value if it
  * currently holds the `expect` value, reporting `true` on success or
  * `false` on failure. The classes in this package also contain
  * methods to get and unconditionally set values.
  *
  * Building a reference is easy with the provided constructor, which
  * will automatically return the most specific type needed (in the
  * following sample, that's an `AtomicDouble`, inheriting from
  * `AtomicNumber[A]`):
  *
  * {{{
  *   val atomicNumber = Atomic(12.2)
  *
  *   atomicNumber.incrementAndGet()
  *   // => 13.2
  * }}}
  *
  * These also provide useful helpers for atomically mutating of
  * values (i.e. `transform`, `transformAndGet`, `getAndTransform`,
  * etc...) or of numbers of any kind (`incrementAndGet`, `getAndAdd`,
  * etc...).
