/** Represents a [[monix.execution.Cancelable Cancelable]] whose
  * underlying cancelable reference can be swapped for another.
  *
  * Example:
  * {{{
  *   val s = MultiAssignCancelable()
  *   // sets the underlying cancelable
  *   s := Cancelable(() => println("cancel 1")) 
  *   // sets the underlying cancelable, forgetting about previous one
  *   s := Cancelable(() => println("cancel 2"))
  *
  *   s.cancel() // also cancels no.2
  *
  *   // also cancels no.3, because `s` is already canceled
  *   s := Cancelable(() => println("cancel 3")) 
  * }}}
  *
  * Also see:
  *
  *  - [[SerialCancelable]], which is similar, except that it
  *    cancels the old cancelable upon assigning a new cancelable
  *  - [[SingleAssignCancelable]] that is effectively a forward
  *    reference that can be assigned at most once
  *  - [[OrderedCancelable]] that's very similar with
  *    `MultiAssignCancelable`, but with the capability of forcing
  *    ordering on concurrent updates
