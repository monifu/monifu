/** Specification for run-loops, imposed by the `Scheduler`.
  *
  * When executing tasks, a run-loop can always execute tasks
  * asynchronously (by forking logical threads), or it can always
  * execute them synchronously (same thread and call-stack, by
  * using an internal trampoline), or it can do a mixed mode
  * that executes tasks in batches before forking.
  *
  * The specification is considered a recommendation for how
  * run loops should behave, but ultimately it's up to the client
  * to choose the best execution model. This can be related to
  * recursive loops or to events pushed into consumers.
