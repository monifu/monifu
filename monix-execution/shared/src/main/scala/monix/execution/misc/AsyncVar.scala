/** Asynchronous mutable location, that is either empty or contains
  * a value of type `A`.
  *
  * It has 2 fundamental atomic operations:
  *
  *  - [[put]] which fills the var if empty, or blocks
  *    (asynchronously) otherwise until the var is empty again
  *
  *  - [[take]] which empties the var if full, returning the contained
  *    value, or blocks (asynchronously) otherwise until there is
  *    a value to pull
  *
  * The `AsyncVar` is appropriate for building synchronization
  * primitives and performing simple inter-thread communications.
  * If it helps, it's similar with a `BlockingQueue(capacity = 1)`,
  * except that it doesn't block any threads, all waiting being
  * callback-based.
  *
  * Given its asynchronous, non-blocking nature, it can be used on
  * top of Javascript as well.
  *
  * Inspired by `Control.Concurrent.MVar` from Haskell.
