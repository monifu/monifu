  /**
    * This strategy consumes the elements from a `Publisher`
    * one by one, with acknowledgement required for each event.
    *
    * In this mode the consumer must indicate its readiness to
    * receive data after every event and the consumer must wait
    * on that acknowledgement. Technically what this means is that for
    * each element the consumer needs to do a `request(1)` call.
    *
    * This could be the same as `FixedWindow(1)` (see [[FixedWindow]]),
    * however internally implementations can optimize for stop-and-wait
    * flow control. For example a buffer is not necessarily required.
    *
    * Pros and Cons of stop-and-wait strategy:
    *
    *  - the implementation can be simpler
    *  - versus [[FixedWindow]] it doesn't have to wait for the buffer
    *    to fill up, so it's more fair
    *  - the producer needs to wait for acknowledgement on each
    *    event and this is a source of inefficiency

  /**
    * This strategy pre-allocates a buffer of the given size and waits
    * for it to fill up before emitting it downstream.
    *
    * Additional events are requested only after the buffer is
    * emitted.
    *
    * This strategy is more efficient than [[StopAndWait]], but
    * less fair. For example if you have a producer that emits
    * a tick every second, with a `bufferSize` of 10 the consumer
    * will only see events every 10 seconds. Therefore it should
    * be used with a busy source, but for slow producers
    * [[StopAndWait]] is a better strategy.
