/** Adds trampoline execution capabilities to
  * [[monix.execution.Scheduler schedulers]], when
  * inherited.
  *
  * When it receives [[TrampolinedRunnable]] instances, it
  * switches to a trampolined mode where all incoming
  * [[TrampolinedRunnable]] are executed on the current thread.
  *
  * This is useful for light-weight callbacks. The idea is
  * borrowed from the implementation of
  * `scala.concurrent.Future`. Currently used as an
  * optimization by `Task` in processing its internal callbacks.
