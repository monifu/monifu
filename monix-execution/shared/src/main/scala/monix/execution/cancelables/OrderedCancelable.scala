/** Represents a [[monix.execution.Cancelable Cancelable]] whose
  * underlying cancelable reference can be swapped for another and
  * that has the capability to force ordering of updates.
  *
  * For the most part it's very similar with [[MultiAssignCancelable]]:
  * {{{
  *   val s = OrderedCancelable()
  *   s := c1 // sets the underlying cancelable to c1
  *   s := c2 // swaps the underlying cancelable to c2
  *
  *   s.cancel() // also cancels c2
  *
  *   s := c3 // also cancels c3, because s is already canceled
  * }}}
  *
  * However it also has the capability of doing
  * [[OrderedCancelable#orderedUpdate orderedUpdate]]:
  * {{{
  *   val s = OrderedCancelable()
  *
  *   ec.execute(new Runnable {
  *     def run() =
  *       s.orderedUpdate(ref2, 2)
  *   })
  *
  *   // The ordered updates are guarding against reversed ordering
  *   // due to the created thread being able to execute before the
  *   // following update
  *   s.orderedUpdate(ref1, 1)
  * }}}
  *
  * Also see:
  *
  *  - [[SerialCancelable]], which is similar, except that it
  *    cancels the old cancelable upon assigning a new cancelable
  *  - [[SingleAssignCancelable]] that is effectively a forward
  *    reference that can be assigned at most once
  *  - [[MultiAssignCancelable]] that's very similar with
  *    `OrderedCancelable`, but simpler, without the capability of
  *    doing ordered updates and possibly more efficient
