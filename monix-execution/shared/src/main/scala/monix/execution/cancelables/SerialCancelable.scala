/** Represents a [[monix.execution.Cancelable]] whose underlying cancelable
  * can be swapped for another cancelable which causes the previous underlying
  * cancelable to be canceled.
  *
  * Example:
  * {{{
  *   val s = SerialCancelable()
  *   s := c1 // sets the underlying cancelable to c1
  *   s := c2 // cancels c1 and swaps the underlying cancelable to c2
  *
  *   s.cancel() // also cancels c2
  *
  *   s := c3 // also cancels c3, because s is already canceled
  * }}}
  *
  * Also see [[OrderedCancelable]], which is similar, but doesn't cancel
  * the old cancelable upon assignment.
