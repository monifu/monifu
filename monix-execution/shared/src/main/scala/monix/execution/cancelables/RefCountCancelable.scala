/** Represents a `Cancelable` that only executes the canceling logic when all
  * dependent cancelable objects have been canceled.
  *
  * The given callback gets called after our `RefCountCancelable` is canceled
  * and after all dependent cancelables have been canceled along with the
  * main cancelable.
  *
  * In other words, lets say for example that we have `acquired` 2 children.
  * In order for the cancelable to get canceled, we need to:
  *
  *  - cancel both children
  *  - cancel the main `RefCountCancelable`
  *
  * The implementation is thread-safe and cancellation order doesn't matter.
