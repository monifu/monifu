/** Cancelables represent asynchronous units of work or other things scheduled for
  * execution and whose execution can be canceled.
  *
  * One use-case is the scheduling done by [[monix.execution.Scheduler]], in which
  * the scheduling methods return a `Cancelable`, allowing the canceling of the
  * scheduling.
  *
  * Example:
  * {{{
  *   val s = ConcurrentScheduler()
  *   val task = s.scheduleRepeated(10.seconds, 50.seconds, {
  *     doSomething()
  *   })
  *
  *   // later, cancels the scheduling ...
  *   task.cancel()
  * }}}
