/** Asynchronous mutable location, that is either empty or contains
  * a value of type `A`.
  *
  * It has these fundamental atomic operations:
  *
  *  - [[put]] which fills the var if empty, or waits
  *    (asynchronously) otherwise until the var is empty again
  *    (with the [[putByCallback]] overload)
  *
  *  - [[tryPut]] which fills the var if empty, returning `true`
  *    if it succeeded, or returning immediately `false` in case
  *    the var was full and thus the operation failed
  *
  *  - [[take]] which empties the var if full, returning the contained
  *    value, or waits (asynchronously) otherwise until there is
  *    a value to pull (with the [[takeByCallback]] overload)
  *
  *  - [[tryTake]] which empties the var if full, returning the
  *    contained value immediately as `Some(a)`, or otherwise returning
  *    `None` in case the var was empty and thus the operation failed
  *
  *  - [[read]] which reads the var if full, but without taking it
  *    from the interval var, or waits (asynchronously) until
  *    there is a value to read
  *
  *  - [[tryRead]] tries reading the var without modifying it in
  *    any way; if full then returns `Some(a)`, or `None` if empty
  *
  * The `AsyncVar` is appropriate for building synchronization
  * primitives and performing simple inter-thread communications.
  * If it helps, it's similar with a `BlockingQueue(capacity = 1)`,
  * except that it doesn't block any threads, all waiting being
  * callback-based.
  *
  * Given its asynchronous, non-blocking nature, it can be used on
  * top of Javascript as well.
  *
  * This is inspired by
  * [[https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base/docs/Control-Concurrent-MVar.html Control.Concurrent.MVar]]
  * from Haskell, except that the implementation is made to work with
  * plain Scala futures (and is thus impure).
  *
  * @define awaitParam is a callback that will be called when the
  *         operation succeeded with a result
  *
  * @define cancelableReturn a cancelable token that can be used to cancel
  *         the computation to avoid memory leaks in race conditions
