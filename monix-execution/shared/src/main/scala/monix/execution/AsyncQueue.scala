/**
  * A high-performance, back-pressured, asynchronous queue implementation.
  *
  * This is the impure, future-enabled version of [[monix.catnap.ConcurrentQueue]].
  *
  * ==Example==
  *
  * {{{
  *   import monix.execution.Scheduler.Implicits.global
  *
  *   val queue = AsyncQueue(capacity = 32)
  *
  *   def producer(n: Int): CancelableFuture[Unit] =
  *     queue.offer(n).flatMap { _ =>
  *       if (n >= 0) producer(n - 1)
  *       else CancelableFuture.unit
  *     }
  *
  *   def consumer(index: Int): CancelableFuture[Unit] =
  *     queue.poll().flatMap { a =>
  *       println(s"Worker $$index: $$a")
  *     }
  * }}}
  *
  * ==Back-Pressuring and the Polling Model==
  *
  * The initialized queue can be limited to a maximum buffer size, a size
  * that could be rounded to a power of 2, so you can't rely on it to be
  * precise. Such a bounded queue can be initialized via
  * [[monix.execution.AsyncQueue.bounded AsyncQueue.bounded]].
  * Also see [[BufferCapacity]], the configuration parameter that can be
  * passed in the [[monix.execution.AsyncQueue.custom AsyncQueue.custom]]
  * builder.
  *
  * On [[offer]], when the queue is full, the implementation back-pressures
  * until the queue has room again in its internal buffer, the future being
  * completed when the value was pushed successfully. Similarly [[poll]] awaits
  * the queue to have items in it. This works for both bounded and unbounded queues.
  *
  * For both `offer` and `poll`, in case awaiting a result happens, the
  * implementation does so asynchronously, without any threads being blocked.
  *
  * Currently the implementation is optimized for speed. In a producer-consumer
  * pipeline the best performance is achieved if the producer(s) and the
  * consumer(s) do not contend for the same resources. This is why when
  * doing asynchronous waiting for the queue to be empty or full, the
  * implementation does so by repeatedly retrying the operation, with
  * asynchronous boundaries and delays, until it succeeds. Fairness is
  * ensured by the implementation.
  *
  * ==Multi-threading Scenario==
  *
  * This queue support a [[ChannelType]] configuration, for fine tuning
  * depending on the needed multi-threading scenario â€” and this can yield
  * better performance:
  *
  *   - [[ChannelType.MPMC]]: multi-producer, multi-consumer
  *   - [[ChannelType.MPSC]]: multi-producer, single-consumer
  *   - [[ChannelType.SPMC]]: single-producer, multi-consumer
  *   - [[ChannelType.SPSC]]: single-producer, single-consumer
  *
  * The default is `MPMC`, because that's the safest scenario.
  *
  * {{{
  *   import monix.execution.ChannelType.MPSC
  *
  *   val queue = AsyncQueue(
  *     capacity = 64,
  *     channelType = MPSC
  *   )
  * }}}
  *
  * '''WARNING''': default is `MPMC`, however any other scenario implies
  * a relaxation of the internal synchronization between threads.
  *
  * This means that using the wrong scenario can lead to severe
  * concurrency bugs. If you're not sure what multi-threading scenario you
  * have, then just stick with the default `MPMC`.
